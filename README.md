# Project 1

In this project, I am tasked with creating a basic calculator using Python language. It lets the user be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. First, the calculator asks the user to input a mathematical operation they would like to use such as '+', '-', '*', and '/'. Once the user picks their chosen operation, the calculator then asks for the first and second numbers. For division, it will ask the user to input the dividend and the divisor in order. One special function of the calculator is finding the square root which is represented by 'sqrt'. Then, they can type the number they want to square root. At the end, the calculator provideds the user with the answer. However, it is unacceptable to input any other character other than the operations and functions mentioned above. For example, if a user inputs '@', the calculator will reject it and let the user know that their input is invalid and try again.
